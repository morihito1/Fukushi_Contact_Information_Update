# Mark As Read/Unread

> **Agent instruction — read all linked docs before proceeding:** Follow and read every hyperlinked reference document on this page in full before generating XAML. XAML structural patterns (BackupSlots, StoredValue, x:Reference, all-null attributes, namespace declarations) are defined in the linked component, type, and filter docs — not repeated here. If those linked docs also contain hyperlinks to other reference docs, follow those too.

> **Agent instruction — connection:** Before writing XAML, use the available tooling to resolve or search for a connection ID for the connector listed in this doc. If the connection ID cannot be resolved, leave `ConnectionId="{x:Null}"`.

## Notes

- Prefer using this activity **outside** of [`GSuiteApplicationScope`](GSuiteApplicationScope.md). `*Connections` activities authenticate via Integration Service independently — no scope wrapper required. Place inside the scope only when Integration Service is unavailable or when using API Key, OAuth Client ID, or Service Account credentials directly via the scope.
- The `Email` property is required.
